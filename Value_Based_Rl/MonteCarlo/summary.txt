BLACKJACK & MONTE CARLO REINFORCEMENT LEARNING SUMMARY
======================================================

1. BLACKJACK EXPLAINED
----------------------
Blackjack (also known as Twenty-One) is a card game where players compete against the dealer.

Goal:
Beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

Card Values:
- Face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10.
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Aces are worth 1 or 11 (whichever is better).

The Play:
1. The player is dealt two cards.
2. The dealer is dealt two cards, one face up (visible) and one face down (hidden).
3. The player has two main actions:
   - Hit: Take another card.
   - Stick (Stand): Stop taking cards and keep the current total.
4. If the player's total exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose immediately.
5. If the player sticks, the dealer reveals their hidden card and must hit until their total is 17 or higher.
6. If the dealer busts (goes over 21), the player wins (if they haven't already busted).
7. If neither busts, the higher total wins. A tie is a "push" (draw).

2. WHY MONTE CARLO FOR THIS TASK?
---------------------------------
Monte Carlo (MC) methods are well-suited for Blackjack for several reasons:

- Episodic Nature: Blackjack games are always separate "episodes" that end in a Win, Loss, or Draw. MC learns from these complete episodes.
- Unknown Dynamics: We don't need to calculate exact probabilities of card draws. The agent learns simply by playing many games and observing the played cards.
- State Space: The game state (Player Sum 4-21, Dealer Card 1-10, Usable Ace Y/N) is small enough for a table but complex enough to require learning.
- Delayed Reward: The result (Win/Loss) is only known at the very end. MC naturally handles this by propagating the final result back to all actions taken during the hand.

3. METRICS COMPARISON
---------------------
In Blackjack, even a perfect strategy cannot win every time due to the luck of the draw.

Metric       | Ideal Strategy | Random Strategy | Trained MC Agent
----------------------------------------------------------------
Win Rate     | ~42.5 - 43.0%  | ~28.0%          | ~43.0%
Loss Rate    | ~49.0%         | ~67.0%          | ~48.0%
Draw Rate    | ~8.5%          | ~5.0%           | ~9.0%

(Note: Percentages may vary slightly based on specific house rules.)

Why not 100%?
The casino ("the house") always has a slight statistical advantage. The goal of our AI agent is to find the "Optimal Policy" that minimizes this advantage, typically achieving a win rate of around 43%.
