MONTE CARLO AGENT FLOW DESCRIPTION
==================================

1. TRAINING FLOW (train.py)
---------------------------
The training process uses the First-Visit Monte Carlo method to learn the optimal policy.

A. INITIALIZATION
   - Create Blackjack environment (Gymnasium).
   - Initialize Q-table (a dictionary mapping states to action values).
   - Initialize Returns dictionary (stores all returns for each state-action pair).
   - Set hyperparameters (Epsilon, Gamma, Decay Rate).

B. EPISODE LOOP (Repeats 500,000 times)
   1. Reset Environment: Start a new game.
   2. Play Episode:
      - Choose action using Epsilon-Greedy policy (Explore vs Exploit).
      - Step environment (Hit or Stick).
      - Store (State, Action, Reward) in a list.
      - Repeat until game ends (Terminal state).

C. MONTE CARLO UPDATE (End of Episode)
   1. Calculate Return (G): Iterate backwards from the last step of the episode.
   2. First-Visit Check: For each step, check if this (State, Action) pair occurred earlier in the episode.
   3. Update:
      - If it is the first visit, add G to the Returns list for that pair.
      - Update Q-value = Average of all Returns for that pair.

D. FINALIZATION
   - Decay Epsilon (reduce exploration).
   - Log win rates periodically.
   - Save the learnt Q-table to 'blackjack_mc.pkl'.
   - Generate and save 'training_plot.png'.


2. EVALUATION FLOW (eval.py)
----------------------------
The evaluation process tests the trained agent's performance without exploration.

A. SETUP
   - Create Blackjack environment.
   - Load 'blackjack_mc.pkl' (the Q-table created during training).

B. STATISTICAL EVALUATION (100,000 Episodes)
   1. Reset Environment.
   2. Play Episode using Greedy Policy (Always choose action with highest Q-value).
   3. Record result (Win, Loss, or Draw).
   4. Calculate and print aggregate Win Rate.

C. VISUAL DEMO
   1. Re-initialize environment with 'render_mode="human"' (Pygame).
   2. Play 5 episodes using the Greedy Policy.
   3. Display the game window so the user can watch the agent playing.
